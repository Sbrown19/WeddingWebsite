<h1>Our Story</h1>
<!-- What all do we want here?-->
<!--Ask megan if she wants me to type out dates or does she want it in numeric form-->
<!--Ask megan if she thinks it was a late lunch or early dinner-->
<!-- Does megan want the reason why we went there due to it being special to her in this-->
<!--Debate on the cookie thing maybe reword it as megan-->
<p>Our story in a nutshell: The very first time we actually met was while I was walking down the hallway at Valley View Village health care center. Megan saw me and held open the door for me. Later that night we started talking on Facebook.
We decided to hang out at a park and we ended up going on a nice walk. We stayed up that whole night talking and getting to know each other. On May 8th 2015, 
we went to an early dinner at KFC in Altoona. Then we went to the capital because I had never been there and she wanted to take me. When we got there I asked her to be my cookie with a KFC cookie.</p>
<p>After many movies, shows, and adventures later, we had been together for three years, about to go on four. I was talking to my mom and asked for one of her diamonds from a ring to give Megan. I was really nervous to talk to Megan's dad to get his blessing. We grew closer that day. I had it made into an engagement ring. 
Once I got the ring, we reinacted the day we went to the capital. Once we got done with a fun trivia game about our relationship, we walked to the same spot that it all started.
When she had her back to me, I got on my knee and asked her to marry me.</p>
